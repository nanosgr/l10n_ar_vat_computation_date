Features
========

* Automatically calculates VAT computation date when posting invoices in locked periods
* Replaces VAT credit account with temporary account in original entry

* Multi-company configuration for VAT account mapping
* Full traceability between invoices and adjustment entries

Configuration
=============

#. Go to Accounting > Configuration > Settings
#. Under "Argentina" section, find "VAT Credit Deferred Computation"
#. Configure:

   * IVA Crédito Fiscal Account (definitive account used in normal periods)
   * IVA Crédito Fiscal a Computar Account (temporary account for deferred VAT)

#. Create a General journal with code "AJIVA" for VAT adjustments (if not exists)

Usage
=====

The module works automatically:

#. Lock a fiscal period (Accounting > Accounting > Lock Dates)
#. Create a purchase invoice with accounting date in the locked period
#. Post the invoice
#. The system will:

   * Calculate `l10n_ar_vat_computation_date` (first day of next open period)
   * Replace VAT credit account with temporary account in the invoice entry
   * Create and post an adjustment entry on the computation date
   * Link both entries for traceability

#. Use smart buttons to navigate between invoice and adjustment entry
